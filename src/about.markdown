I am a computing enthusiast and budding software engineer interested in anthing
and everything that can be programmed. I'm an avid im user and linux
tinkerer . This is my blog, where I plan to share things I've learned from my
side projects and experiences in the software industry.

I should probably also mention that all thoughts expressed here are my own
and do not necessarily represent the views of my employer.
